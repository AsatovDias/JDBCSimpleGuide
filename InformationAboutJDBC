What is JDBC?
JDBC is a Java API that allows you to:
Connect to a database
Send SQL queries (like SELECT, INSERT, etc.)
Retrieve results
Manage database transactions

ðŸ§± JDBC Architecture
JDBC has two main parts:
JDBC API â€“ Provided by Java, defines interfaces (like Connection, Statement, ResultSet).
JDBC Driver â€“ Provided by the database vendor (like MySQL Connector/J), it implements the interfaces.

Interface	Description
DriverManager	Manages JDBC drivers and connections
Connection	Represents a connection to the DB
Statement	Executes static SQL queries
PreparedStatement	Executes parameterized SQL queries (safer)
ResultSet	Holds data retrieved from a SELECT query
